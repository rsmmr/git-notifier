0.8-2 | 2025-03-29 10:13:47 +0100

  * Add new flag ``--commitsonly`` to limit mails to actual commits. (Robin Sommer)

    This skips reporting of new tags and branches, and heads that were
    moved.

  * Remove spurious file. (Robin Sommer)

0.8 | 2023-02-03 07:24:44 +0100

  * Ignore invalid UTF-8 in diffs. (Robin Sommer)

0.7-42 | 2021-12-13 10:53:49 +0100

  * Check both GL_ADMIN_BASE and GL_ADMINDIR when looking for
    sender.cfg. Reported (a while ago) by Mark Allman. (Robin Sommer)

0.7-41 | 2021-11-09 17:59:40 +0100

  * github-notifier: Support globs when selecting repositories. So far
    we only allowed for an exact string `*` to mean "all
    repositories". Now we actually expand globs when the repository
    name contains any `*` (e.g., `repositories=zeek/spicy-*`). This
    works for exclusions as well (e.g.,
    `repositorieszeek/*,-zeek/spicy-*`). (Robin Sommer)

0.7-40 | 2019-03-10 08:29:53 -0700

  * No longer go through the shell to run commands from git-notifier
    and github-notifier. (Samir Aguiar)

  * Support GitHub Wiki repositories in github-notifier. (Wolfgang
    Schnerring)

0.7-35 | 2018-10-20 15:36:14 -0700

  * Add -public/-private github-notifier option suffixes These allow
    github-notifier configuration options to conditionally apply based
    upon a given GitHub repo's public/private status. (Jon Siwek)

0.7-33 | 2018-09-28 07:55:15 -0700

  * Call git's diff-tree with "--ext-diff" to support externl diff
    drivers. (Stas Bekman)

0.7-31 | 2018-05-21 15:17:31 -0700

  * Add support for custom headers in mail messages.  This adds
    support for custom headers through "--mailheader-<name>=<value>"
    options either on the command line options, inside the repository
    configuration, or inside the configuration file. (Samir Aguiar)

  * Support for custom log file in github-notifier. github-notifier
    gets a new "[-l|--log]" command line option to allow users to use
    a custom logfile. (Samir Aguiar)

  * Fix "rev-list" call for branch names containing single-quotes.
    (Ronny Schuetz)

  * Make github-notifier compatible with Python-3. (Wolfgang Schnerring)

0.7-17 | 2017-05-21 18:27:33 -0700

  * Sync tag/branch deletion by fetching with --prune. (Robert
    Korulczyk)

0.7-15 | 2017-03-17 16:26:14 -0700

  * Disable 'maxage' check when zero, as the docs say. (Jeff Stein)

  * Correct 'maxage' and 'maxdiffsize' parsing from config. Integers
    were not getting parsed correctly from configuration files. (Jeff
    Stein)

  * Support SMTP port in the mail server setting, and remove the old
    colon-syntax for specifying mail server credentials. (Jeff Stein)

0.7-10 | 2017-01-11 00:37:35 -0500

  * For new tags send emails with the tagger's address. Addresses #17.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.7-9 | 2016-10-15 10:08:51 -0700

  * Fixing version information. (Robin Sommer)

0.7-8 | 2016-10-15 09:57:18 -0700

  * New SMTP options. (Robin Sommer)

        ``--mailserveruser <user>``
            User name to use for authenticating to the SMTP server.
            ``--mailserverpassword`` must be given as well.

        ``--mailserverpassword <password>``
            Password to use for authenticating to the SMTP server.
            ``--mailserveruser`` must be given as well.

        ``--mailserverfrom <email>``
            Alternative envelope sender address when using an SMTP server.
            By default, the envelope sender is either the ``--sender`` if
            given, or the destination ``--mailinglist`` if not.

  * SMTP sessions are now using TLS. (Robin Sommer)

  * SMTP sessions are now cached across multiple mails. (Robin Sommer)

  * Prettyfing repository names in github-notifier. (Robin Sommer)

  * New option to preserver committer's real name. (Robin Sommer)

    ``--keeprealnames``
            If used along with ``--sender``, the mails will preserve the
            committer's real name in their ``From`` line, while still
            using the ``--sender`` email address. This can be useful if the
            outgoing mail server does not permit setting arbitrary sender
            email addresses.

  * Fix Python version incompatibility. (Robin Sommer)

0.7-3 | 2016-09-28 12:59:27 -0700

  * Adding note that github-notifier requires PyGitHub. (Robin Sommer)

  * Explicitly specifying encoding when reading configuration file.
    Leaving it out could cause exceptions in some settings. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.7-1 | 2016-07-25 08:05:14 -0700

  * Remove use of git option --find-copies-harder. (Robin Sommer)

0.7 | 2016-07-25 07:46:21 -0700

  * Release 0.7.

0.6-26 | 2016-02-25 11:17:13 -0800

  * Adding --textconv to "git diff-tree" command. (Robin Sommer)

0.6-25 | 2015-10-26 16:31:37 -0700

  * Fixing typo in README.rst (Lev Lamberov)

  * Adding initial version of manpages. (Lev Lamberov)

0.6-22 | 2015-06-19 17:35:36 -0700

  * Added a configuration option "gitbasedir" for specifying the base
    directory in the file system that holds the git repository. (Jed
    Liu)

  * Support the following substitutions in user-specified
    repositories: '%u' for username, '%h' for hostname, '%r' for repo
    name. (Jed Liu)

  * Ignore vim swap files. (Jed Liu)

  * Abstracted the functionality for obtaining the repository name.
    (Jed Liu)

  * Added configuration file support. See the README for specifics.
    (Jed Liu/Robin Sommer)

  * Use email package to better ensure RFC-compliance, and to better
    automate QP encoding of message bodies. (Jed Liu)

0.6-11 | 2015-05-17 03:05:08 -0700

  * New option --update-only for github-notifier. This only updates
    the local clones of all repositories, but not no run git-notifier
    on them. (Robin Sommer)

0.6-10 | 2015-05-14 22:02:35 -0700

  * Added 'mailcmd' option to allow non-standard sendmail location and
    arguments. (Randall S. Becker)

  * Transfer UTF-8 encoded body as quoted-printable. (Andrei Badea)

  * Fixed exception from mimify when commit author contains non-latin1
    characters. (Andrei Badea)

  * Allow sending mail via SMTP as an alternative to sendmail.
    (Wolfgang Schnerring)

  * Retrieve date of tags properly. (Wolfgang Schnerring)

0.6-5 | 2015-02-23 16:44:14 -0800

  * Retrieve author of tags properly. (Wolfgang Schnerring)

0.6-3 | 2015-01-30 13:53:50 -0800

  * Add a Date header to the email with the original commit date.
    (Wolfgang Schnerring)

0.6-1 | 2015-01-17 08:18:16 -0800

  * Fixing git-notifier to work with Python 2.6. (Vincent Danen)

        - Replace code for getting current time with something more reasonable.
        - Suppress deprecation warning for mimify.

0.6 | 2015-01-08 07:53:04 -0800

  * Release 0.6.

0.5-6 | 2014-11-26 17:12:40 -0800

  * New option to prevent reporting of old commits. (Robin Sommer)

        ``--maxage <days>``
            Limits the age of commits to report. No commit older than this
            many days will trigger a commit notification. Default is 30
            days; zero disables the age check.

    This is primarily a safety measure to prevent mail floods when a
    repository gets messed up.

0.5-5 | 2014-10-24 10:04:04 -0700

  * Adding new option --branches to include/exclude individual branches.

        ``--branches <branches>``
            Lists branches to include/exclude in reporting. By default,
            all branches are included. If this option is specified, only
            branches listed are included. Alternatively, one can prefix a
            branch with ``-`` to *exclude* it: then all but the excluded
            ones are reported. ``<branches>`` is a list of comma-separated
            names of heads to treat this way. (Robin Sommer)

  * Changing quoted-printable header encoding so that it works with
    mutt. (Robin Sommer)

  * allowing --update to work without existing/creating state file.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.5-3 | 2014-05-14 20:10:47 -0700

  * Encode mail headers according to RFC 2047. (Robin Sommer)

  * Don't send any emails for commits that aren't on any branch.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.5 | 2014-01-27 07:42:48 -0800

  * New option to skip updates that a remote already knows.

        ``--ignoreremotes``
            If given, ``git-notifier`` will not report any commits tha
            are already known by any configured remote repository.

    In addition, github-notifier now also updates all remotes when it runs. (Robin Sommer)

  * README updates. (Robin Sommer)

0.42-4 | 2013-09-25 22:15:07 -0700

  * Updating README for github-notifier. (Robin Sommer)

0.42-3 | 2013-09-19 12:12:58 -0700

  * Initial version of new github-notifier script.

    This script mirrors repositories from GitHub locally to then run
    git-notifier on them. Still experimental, documentation
    forthcoming. (Robin Sommer)

0.42-2 | 2013-09-19 12:10:26 -0700

  * Emailprefix can now include %r to include repository name into
    subject. The default emailprefix is now "[git/%r]". (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix for dealing with completely empty repositories. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * For mails with an associated revision, git-notifier now takes the
    commiter's email address to send mails from there if nothing else
    is specified. (Robin Sommer)

0.42 | 2013-09-18 20:02:03 -0700

  * Fix to handle tags with non-standard characters. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-6 | 2013-03-15 08:00:11 -0700

  * Switching back to old behaviour on first run (i.e., no mails). The
    recent updates could easily trigger mail bombs on existing
    repositories. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-5 | 2013-03-13 08:04:55 -0700

  * Sustituting external "whoami" call with something nicer. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.41-4 | 2013-02-17 15:17:23 -0800

  * Falling back to `whoami` if LOGNAME not set. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-3 | 2012-12-17 16:43:13 -0800

  * New option --mailsubjectlen to limit length of mail subjects.
    Based on patch by Fabrizio Buratta. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-2 | 2012-12-17 12:48:24 -0800

  * --updateonly now also applies to initial run. (Matthias Vallentin)

0.41-1 | 2012-11-06 08:36:12 -0800

  * Removing check preventing mails on initialization. (Robin Sommer)

0.41 | 2012-11-03 14:05:45 -0700

  * Version number tweaking. (Robin Sommer)

0.4 | 2012-10-25 15:08:35 -0700

  * Fix "1st commit" issue in automatic mode. (Jan Pokorný)

  * Fix typo/formatting. (Jan Pokorný)

0.3-19 | 2012-09-26 07:50:08 -0700

  * The URL given for the --link option can now contain an "%r"
    placeholder that will be replaced with the name of the repository.
    (Fabrizio Buratta)

0.3-18 | 2012-07-05 08:32:48 -0700

  * When diffs are too large to include, still show a stats summary in the
    mails. (Vincent Danen)

  * New option 'mergediffs'.

     ``--mergediffs <branches>``
            Lists branches for which merges should include the full diff,
            including all changes that are already part of branch commits.
            ``<branches>`` is a list of command-separated names of heads
            to treat this way. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-16 | 2011-08-18 10:31:05 -0700

  * Now showing diffs for merges as well. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-15 | 2011-08-12 09:07:27 -0700

  * Updating CHANGES. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-13 | 2011-08-11 10:15:56 -0700

  * Mails are now sent out in chronological order. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-12 | 2011-07-31 21:45:00 -0700

  * A number of bug fixes.  (Robin Sommer)

0.3-7 | 2011-07-30 10:33:30 -0700

  * New option --replyto to set a Reply-To header for mails. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.3-6 | 2011-07-24 15:52:44 -0700

  * Using diff-tree instead of diff as it allows us to give just a
    single revision. (Robin Sommer)

  * With --allchanges, a revision previously reported in a branch and
    now for one of the --allchanges heads, will have only the latter
    in the mail subject. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-5 | 2011-07-22 15:59:12 -0700

  * Further tweaking allchanges. We now don't do real diffs anymore at
    all, that's just not reliable. Instead, we simply always report
    new revisions for allchanges heads no matter if they have already
    been reported.

0.3-4 | 2011-07-19 19:19:46 -0700

  * Fixing the 0.3-3 change for diffs, which didn't work right. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.3-3 | 2011-07-17 22:15:14 -0700

  * For heads that get full diffs, we now record which diffs we have
    already mailed out. This avoid duplicates when stuff is merged into
    something else later. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-2 | 2011-07-14 11:17:44 -0700

  * Removing debugging output. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-1 | 2011-07-12 14:35:53 -0700

  * Fixing a problem with diffing potentially skipping revisions when
    facing merges. (Robin Sommer)

0.3 | 2011-05-08 21:33:08 -0700

  * Significant speed improvement: we now query git for the branches
    reachable from a revision rather than trying to figure it out
    ourselves. Based on a suggestion by Simon Marlow.

  * Adding git repository to README.

  * Compatibility fix to support older git versions. (Simon Marlow)

  * New option 'link' to define a URL that will be inserted into
    notification mails.

  * New option 'repouri' to overide the automatically derived
    repository location.

  * All options can now indeed be given via git-config (as the README
    already claims), and they are now all located in the hooks.*
    namespace.

  * Integer options are now correctly converted to ints when read from
    git-config.

  * Internal rewrite of how options are implemented.

  * Removing the update-changes script from the repository.

  * Now using gitolite's GL_ADMINDIR environment variable to locate
    the default sender.cfg.

  * We now keep the previous state file as *.bak.

  * Fixing a bug with revisions not being part of any head.

  * Now hooks.allchanges can be specified via "git config".

  * New options, two of them primarily for debugging and manual
    generation of notifications.

        ``--allchanges <branches>``
            Lists branches for which *all* changes made to them should
            be mailed out as straight diffs to their previous state,
            independent of whether the corresponding commit has already
            been reported in the past. This might for example make sense
            for ``master`` if one wants to closely track any
            modification applied. ``<branches>`` is a list of
            command-separated names of heads to treat this way.

        ``--diff [rev1..]rev2``
            Mails out diffs between all revisions on the first parent's
            way from ``rev1`` to ``rev2``. This option produces output
            similar to that of a head moving forward which is listed
            with ``--allchanges``. If ``rev1`` is skipped, ``rev2~1`` is
            assumed.

            This option is primarily for debugging and retropective
            (re-)generation of this outut, and does not change the
            current notifier state in any way. The main difference to
            ``--manual`` is that it considers only revision on the first
            parent's path, and mails out actual diffs between these.

        ``--manual [rev1..]rev2``
            Mails out notifications for all revisions on the way from
            ``rev1`` to ``rev2``. If ``rev1`` is skipped, ``rev2~1`` is
            assumed.

            This option is primarily for debugging and retropective
            (re-)generation of this output, and does not change the
            current notifier state in any way.

0.2 | 2011-01-07 10:06:31 -0800

  * The script now waits a little bit after sending out each mail.
    Before, mails sent back-to-back could arrive with identical
    timestamps, making it harder to determine their actual order.


0.1-5 | 2011-01-02 10:18:10 -0800

  * Updating update-changes.

0.1-4 | 2011-01-01 22:23:53 -0800 | e201aebe6ab827e2b8b33fb302b9d05bde0d9355

  * Now mails are also sent when a head updates to now include further
    commits that have already been reported earlier (e.g., on
    fast-forwards). These mails summarize all revisions on the path from
    its previous state to the new head position. This is experimental at
    this point.

  * The script now checks for "-h" or "--help" as a command-line
    option, and prints a short (and not very helpful) usage message
    if found.

0.1-3 | 2011-01-01 21:44:11 -0800 | 94154e05ff29522e256803d2cfe9b7d98d28b138

  * Renaming the "recipients" options to "mailinglist", as it was
    already documented. (Matthias Vallentin)

0.1-2 | 2011-01-01 21:41:09 -0800 | b650d20a8d10c9bc8de20c3715c9b1dab9100288

  * Adding "[nomail]" option: if that tag is included in a commit
    message, no mail will be send for that change. Also, documenting the
    already existing "[nodiff]" option: if included in a commit message,
    no diff will be included for that change.

  * Adding update-changes script.

0.1 | 2010-12-19 20:30:38 -0800 | 2606f82b91b0984c9de050c001729ce45dfb69cd

  * Initial version.
