  * New option to skip updates that a remote already knows.

        ``--ignoreremotes``
            If given, ``git-notifier`` will not report any commits tha
            are already known by any configured remote repository.

    In addition, github-notifier now also updates all remotes when it runs. (Robin Sommer)

  * README updates. (Robin Sommer)

0.42-4 | 2013-09-25 22:15:07 -0700

  * Updating README for github-notifier. (Robin Sommer)

0.42-3 | 2013-09-19 12:12:58 -0700

  * Initial version of new github-notifier script.
    
    This script mirrors repositories from GitHub locally to then run
    git-notifier on them. Still experimental, documentation
    forthcoming. (Robin Sommer)

0.42-2 | 2013-09-19 12:10:26 -0700

  * Emailprefix can now include %r to include repository name into
    subject. The default emailprefix is now "[git/%r]". (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix for dealing with completely empty repositories. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * For mails with an associated revision, git-notifier now takes the
    commiter's email address to send mails from there if nothing else
    is specified. (Robin Sommer)

0.42 | 2013-09-18 20:02:03 -0700

  * Fix to handle tags with non-standard characters. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-6 | 2013-03-15 08:00:11 -0700

  * Switching back to old behaviour on first run (i.e., no mails). The
    recent updates could easily trigger mail bombs on existing
    repositories. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-5 | 2013-03-13 08:04:55 -0700

  * Sustituting external "whoami" call with something nicer. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.41-4 | 2013-02-17 15:17:23 -0800

  * Falling back to `whoami` if LOGNAME not set. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-3 | 2012-12-17 16:43:13 -0800

  * New option --mailsubjectlen to limit length of mail subjects.
    Based on patch by Fabrizio Buratta. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-2 | 2012-12-17 12:48:24 -0800

  * --updateonly now also applies to initial run. (Matthias Vallentin)
    
0.41-1 | 2012-11-06 08:36:12 -0800

  * Removing check preventing mails on initialization. (Robin Sommer)

0.41 | 2012-11-03 14:05:45 -0700

  * Version number tweaking. (Robin Sommer)

0.4 | 2012-10-25 15:08:35 -0700

  * Fix "1st commit" issue in automatic mode. (Jan Pokorný)

  * Fix typo/formatting. (Jan Pokorný)

0.3-19 | 2012-09-26 07:50:08 -0700

  * The URL given for the --link option can now contain an "%r"
    placeholder that will be replaced with the name of the repository.
    (Fabrizio Buratta)

0.3-18 | 2012-07-05 08:32:48 -0700

  * When diffs are too large to include, still show a stats summary in the
    mails. (Vincent Danen)

  * New option 'mergediffs'.

     ``--mergediffs <branches>``
            Lists branches for which merges should include the full diff,
            including all changes that are already part of branch commits.
            ``<branches>`` is a list of command-separated names of heads
            to treat this way. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-16 | 2011-08-18 10:31:05 -0700

  * Now showing diffs for merges as well. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-15 | 2011-08-12 09:07:27 -0700

  * Updating CHANGES. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-13 | 2011-08-11 10:15:56 -0700

  * Mails are now sent out in chronological order. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-12 | 2011-07-31 21:45:00 -0700

  * A number of bug fixes.  (Robin Sommer)

0.3-7 | 2011-07-30 10:33:30 -0700

  * New option --replyto to set a Reply-To header for mails. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.3-6 | 2011-07-24 15:52:44 -0700

  * Using diff-tree instead of diff as it allows us to give just a
    single revision. (Robin Sommer)

  * With --allchanges, a revision previously reported in a branch and
    now for one of the --allchanges heads, will have only the latter
    in the mail subject. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-5 | 2011-07-22 15:59:12 -0700

  * Further tweaking allchanges. We now don't do real diffs anymore at
    all, that's just not reliable. Instead, we simply always report
    new revisions for allchanges heads no matter if they have already
    been reported.

0.3-4 | 2011-07-19 19:19:46 -0700

  * Fixing the 0.3-3 change for diffs, which didn't work right. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.3-3 | 2011-07-17 22:15:14 -0700

  * For heads that get full diffs, we now record which diffs we have
    already mailed out. This avoid duplicates when stuff is merged into
    something else later. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-2 | 2011-07-14 11:17:44 -0700

  * Removing debugging output. (Robin Sommer)

0.3-1 | 2011-07-12 14:35:53 -0700

  * Fixing a problem with diffing potentially skipping revisions when
    facing merges. (Robin Sommer)

0.3 | 2011-05-08 21:33:08 -0700

  * Significant speed improvement: we now query git for the branches
    reachable from a revision rather than trying to figure it out
    ourselves. Based on a suggestion by Simon Marlow.

  * Adding git repository to README.

  * Compatibility fix to support older git versions. (Simon Marlow)

  * New option 'link' to define a URL that will be inserted into
    notification mails.

  * New option 'repouri' to overide the automatically derived
    repository location.

  * All options can now indeed be given via git-config (as the README
    already claims), and they are now all located in the hooks.*
    namespace.

  * Integer options are now correctly converted to ints when read from
    git-config.

  * Internal rewrite of how options are implemented.

  * Removing the update-changes script from the repository.

  * Now using gitolite's GL_ADMINDIR environment variable to locate
    the default sender.cfg.

  * We now keep the previous state file as *.bak.

  * Fixing a bug with revisions not being part of any head.

  * Now hooks.allchanges can be specified via "git config".

  * New options, two of them primarily for debugging and manual
    generation of notifications.

        ``--allchanges <branches>``
            Lists branches for which *all* changes made to them should
            be mailed out as straight diffs to their previous state,
            independent of whether the corresponding commit has already
            been reported in the past. This might for example make sense
            for ``master`` if one wants to closely track any
            modification applied. ``<branches>`` is a list of
            command-separated names of heads to treat this way.

        ``--diff [rev1..]rev2``
            Mails out diffs between all revisions on the first parent's
            way from ``rev1`` to ``rev2``. This option produces output
            similar to that of a head moving forward which is listed
            with ``--allchanges``. If ``rev1`` is skipped, ``rev2~1`` is
            assumed.

            This option is primarily for debugging and retropective
            (re-)generation of this outut, and does not change the
            current notifier state in any way. The main difference to
            ``--manual`` is that it considers only revision on the first
            parent's path, and mails out actual diffs between these.

        ``--manual [rev1..]rev2``
            Mails out notifications for all revisions on the way from
            ``rev1`` to ``rev2``. If ``rev1`` is skipped, ``rev2~1`` is
            assumed.

            This option is primarily for debugging and retropective
            (re-)generation of this output, and does not change the
            current notifier state in any way.

0.2 | 2011-01-07 10:06:31 -0800

  * The script now waits a little bit after sending out each mail.
    Before, mails sent back-to-back could arrive with identical
    timestamps, making it harder to determine their actual order.


0.1-5 | 2011-01-02 10:18:10 -0800

  * Updating update-changes.

0.1-4 | 2011-01-01 22:23:53 -0800 | e201aebe6ab827e2b8b33fb302b9d05bde0d9355

  * Now mails are also sent when a head updates to now include further
    commits that have already been reported earlier (e.g., on
    fast-forwards). These mails summarize all revisions on the path from
    its previous state to the new head position. This is experimental at
    this point.

  * The script now checks for "-h" or "--help" as a command-line
    option, and prints a short (and not very helpful) usage message
    if found.

0.1-3 | 2011-01-01 21:44:11 -0800 | 94154e05ff29522e256803d2cfe9b7d98d28b138

  * Renaming the "recipients" options to "mailinglist", as it was
    already documented. (Matthias Vallentin)

0.1-2 | 2011-01-01 21:41:09 -0800 | b650d20a8d10c9bc8de20c3715c9b1dab9100288

  * Adding "[nomail]" option: if that tag is included in a commit
    message, no mail will be send for that change. Also, documenting the
    already existing "[nodiff]" option: if included in a commit message,
    no diff will be included for that change.

  * Adding update-changes script.

0.1 | 2010-12-19 20:30:38 -0800 | 2606f82b91b0984c9de050c001729ce45dfb69cd

  * Initial version.
