  * Now mails are also sent when a head updates to now include further
    commits that have already been reported earlier (e.g., on
    fast-forwards). These mails summarize all revisions on the path from
    its previous state to the new head position. This is experimental at
    this point. (Robin Sommer)

  * The script now checks for "-h" or "--help" as a command-line
    option, and prints a short (and not very helpful) usage message
    if found. (Robin Sommer)

  * Renaming the "recipients" options to "mailinglist", as it was
    already documented. (Matthias Vallentin)

  * Adding "[nomail]" option: if that tag is included in a commit
    message, no mail will be send for that change. Also, documenting the
    already existing "[nodiff]" option: if included in a commit message,
    no diff will be included for that change. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding update-changes script. (Robin Sommer)
