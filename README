Introduction
------------

``git-notifier`` is a script to be used with `git
<http://www.git.org>`_ as a `post-receive <XXX>`_ hook. Once
installed, it emails out a summary of all changes each time a user
pushes an update to the repository. Different from other similar
scripts, ``git-notifier`` sends exactly one email per change, each
of which includes a complete diff of all modifications as well as
the set of branches from which the new revision can be reached. The
scripts ensure that that each change is mailed out only exactly once
by keeping a state file of already reported revisions. The script
integrates nicely with `gitolite <https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite>`_.

Here's example of such a ``git-notifier`` mail::

    Subject: [git/git-notifier] master: Adding www target to Makefile. (7dc1f95)

In addition, ``git-notifier`` also mails updates when branches or
annotated tags are created or removed.

If a commit message contains ``[nodiff]``, the generated mail will
not include a diff. If a commit message contains ``[nomail]``, no
mail will be send for that change. 

Download

Installation
------------

The basic installation is simple: just run the script from
``hooks/post-receive``, as in::

    #!/bin/sh
    
    /full/path/to/git-notifier

By default, the script will send its mails to the user running the
``git-notifier`` (i.e., the one doing the update). As that's usually
not the desired recipient, an alternative email address can be
specified via command line or git options, see the ``mailinglist``
option below.

Usage
-----

``git-notifier`` supports the options below. Alternatively to 
giving them on the command line, all of them can alse be set via
``git config hooks.<option>``. For example, to set a recipient
address, do ``git config hooks.mailinglist git-updates@foo.com``:

    ``--debug``
        Prints the mails that would normally be generated to
        standard error instead, without sending them. The output
        also includes some further debugging information, like the
        git commands being executed during operation.

        Note that in debug mode, the script still updates its state
        file, i.e., if there are changes that haven't been reported
        yet, they will only be printed, not mailed out next time. If
        you don't want that, use ``--noupdate`` as well.

    ``--emailprefix``
        Specifies a prefix for the mails' subject line. Default is
        ``[git]``. Note that the name of this option is compatible
        with some of other git notification scripts. 

    ``--hostname <name>``
        Defines the hostname to use when building the repository
        path shown in the notification mails. Default is the
        canonical name of the system the script is running on. 

    ``--log <file>``
        Write logging information into the given file. Default is
        ``git-notifier.log`` inside the repository. 

    ``--mailinglist <address>``
        Specifies the recipient for all generated mails. Default is
        mailing to the system account that is running the script.

    ``--maxdiffsize <size in KB>``
        Limits the size of mails by giving a maximum number of bytes
        that a diff may have. If the diff for a change is larger
        than this value, a notification mail is still send out but
        the diff is excluded (and replaced with a note saying so).
        Default is 50K. 

    ``--noupdate``
        Does not update the internal state file, meaning that any
        updates will be reported *again* next time the script is
        run.

    ``--sender <address>``
        Defines the sender address for all generated mails. Default
        is the user doing the update (if gitolite is used, that's 
        the gitolite acccount doing the push, not the system account
        running ``git-notifier``.)

    ``--updateonly``
        Does not send out any mail notifications but still updates
        the index. In other words, all recent changes will be marked
        as "seen", without reporting them.

    ``--users <file>``
        This is only for installations using gitolite <XXX>, for
        which the default sender address for all mails would
        normally be the gitolite user account name of the person
        doing the push. With this option, one can alternatively
        specify a file that maps such account names to alternative
        addresses, which will then be used as the sender for mails.

        The file must consist of line of the form ``<gitolite-user>
        <sender>``, where sender will be used for the mails and can
        include spaces. Empty lines and lines starting with ``#``
        are ignored. It's ok if for a user no entry is found, in
        which case the default value will be used. 

        For example, if there's a gitolite user account "joe", one
        could provide a ``users`` file like this::

            joe    Joe Smith <joe@foo.bar>

        Now all mails triggered by Joe will have the specified
        sender.

        Note that even if ``--users`` is not given, ``git-notifier``
        will still look for such a file in ``../conf/sender.cfg``',
        relative to the top-level repository directory. In other
        words, you can check a file ``sender.cfg`` containing the
        mappings into gitolite's ``config/`` directory and it should
        Just Work.
